#      ppi-server config file of measure routines
#      writen by Alexander Kolli <ppi@magnificat.at>
#
#
#  this config file com.conf have same structure of folder and subroutines like measure.conf. 
#  On this time the LPT interface and type RWPORT is not realy implemented. I use an developer how want to test.
#
#
#   TYPES:          properties and actions:
#	PORT		properties: <ID>, <pin>, [begin|while|end], [priority], [cache], [perm]
#			actions= [current], [cache]
#	    [measure pin to get an contact or set pin under power	]
#
#	MPORT		properties: <ID>, <pin>, [out], [neg], [cache]
#			actions= [current], [cache], [freeze]
#	    [measure pin to get an contact or set pin under power	]
#
#	RWPORT		properties: <ID>
#			actions= <read|write> (or both if nothing set
#	    [measure pin to get an contact or set pin under power	]
#
#   PROPERTIES:
#	ID		 - COM1, COM2, ... or LPT1, LPT2, ...
#	pin		 - pin from COM or LPT port witch get or write contacts by device
#			   pins can be DTR, RTS, TXD, CTS, DSR, RI or DCD for an COM port
#			   DATA1 - 8, ERROR, SELECT, PAPEREMPTY, ACKNOWLEDGE, BUSY, STROBE,
#			   AUTOFEED, INIT or SELECTINPUT for LPT port
#	out		 - pin from COM or LPT port witch can be set
#			   when this parameter be set, the one wire client set this out parameter
#              under power and measure the time witch the power needs to comming
#			   in by parameter pin. After get contact the power to param out is set again to off
#	neg		 - pin from COM or LPT port. If this property be defined
#              the pin is always set to power off
#   value    - which value should be writing
#              if no value be defined, it will be taken the result of begin, while, end (0 or 1)
#              the value can be an defined-value
#              for type PORT
#   begin    - do reading or writing if begin status occurring
#              specific for type TIMER by no set action measure:
#                  subroutine beginning always with full time again
#              for types PORT
#              the value can be an defined-value
#   while    - do reading or writing while state be set
#              parameter beginning only when parameter begin not defined
#              but can ending before parameter end will be reached for ending
#              for types PORT
#              the value can be an defined-value
#   end      - end read or write ending when state occurring
#              for types PORT
#              the value can be an defined-value
#	priority - priority of writing
#              all pins are holding in an queue to write in serie.
#              if in the queue more than one chips/pins 
#              higher prioritys will be concerned of writing before the other
#              (allowed priority 1 (highest) to priority 9999 (lowest))
#	cache    - all chips are reading in an cache always again after this defined seconds
#              If this PROPERTY not be set, the default cache from defaultmaxim.conf be taken
#
#   ACTIONS:
#	read     - if type is an RWPORT the port will be reading
#	write    - if type is an RWPORT the port is for writing
#	current  - only by action read for chips witch reading an contact (0|1 bit),
#              do only read the actual state from chip.
#              Otherwise the server check also whether the pin gets an contact
#              between the last reading
#   cache    - only by action write in one folder by the same chip witch have more 
#              than one pin. It will be write the current state into an queue
#              and write all states by the next pin without action cache
#              to writing simultaneosly
#   db       - writing actual state on database
