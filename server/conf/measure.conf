#      ppi-server config file of measure routines
#      writen by Alexander Kolli <ppi@magnificat.at>
#
#
#  this config file measure.conf have one or more folder which running
#  in extra threads. All folder have one or more subroutines called with attribute name
#  example:
#        folder= <foldername>
#        name= <subroutinename>
#        type= <type as follow>
#        [some properties for subroutine]
#        name= <new subroutine>
#        ...
#        folder= <new foldername>
#        name= <subroutine>
#        ...
#
#  on any place (better before any defined folder, or at end of config file) 
#  can also be defined any external file (with parameter file and value as filename with path)
#  where be the same structure folder and subroutines (see for example the definition bellow).
#  Follow standard types can be set
#  and they need also the properties which in <> brackets or optional properties in [] brackets
#  by the attribute action all values are optional
#  read the description under PROPERTIES and ACTIONS
#
#
#   TYPES:         properties and actions:
#  --------       -------------------------
#
#   DEBUG          properties: [begin&|while&|end], [log], [string], [value], [perm]
#                  actions: print
#             [ this subroutine is only for debugging in the same command line shell where the ppi-server is running,
#               or logging into log-file when property log be set
#               the string from parameter [string] and value from parameter [value] will be written to command line
#               when the case of begin, while, end is given or the subroutine was set from outside
#               maybe with ppi-client to DEBUG (./ppi-client DEBUG <folder>:<subroutine>)
#               The own value of the DEBUG subroutine is true by writing output elsewhere false
#               so you can define more DEBUG subroutines which link to one DEBUG subroutine with property while
#               and you have than set only one DEBUG subroutine to write output.
#               More string parameters and value parameters can be set to define the debug string
#               The output is writing on interaction from [string] and [value]. Begins always with string if set.
#               If the [value] should be the first, define first an null string (string= "")
#               By debugging this subroutine the debug level do not show starting and ending folder in debug mode      ]
#
#   SET            properties: <begin&|while&|end>, <from>, <set>, [perm], [default]
#                  actions: db
#             [ with this subroutine your can set an value from one ore more parameter 'from' to
#               one ore more parameter 'set' in the case of begin, while and end.
#               If you have more 'set' parameter you can have one 'from' parameter, in this case you set all subroutines
#               with the same 'from' parameter value, or the same count of 'from' parameter than 'set'.
#               The own value of the SET subroutine will be true when the case of begin, while, end is given
#               elsewhere false                                                                                               ]
#
#   SHELL          properties: <begin&|while&|end>, <begincommand&|whilecommand&|endcommand>, [runuser]
#                  actions: db, wait, block, noerrorlog
#             [ starts an shell command in the case of <begom|while|end> is correct.
#               The value of the subroutine is the exit code of the starting shell script when action wait be defined,
#               by an ERROR value is -1 or 127. See log File for Errors, or debug subroutine.
#               If action wait not be set value can be 0 when no command produced,
#               1 for begin-, 2 for while- and 3 for endcommand.
#               The script output only be seen when you debug the subroutine with ppi-client DEBUG <folder>:<subroutine>
#               The started script can also write some commands per normally printing over stdout to the ppi-server:
#                       PPI-SET <folder>:<subroutine> <value>
#                                                -     to write directly into ppi-server subroutines
#                                                      you can use the way with an separate connection over ppi-client
#                                                      but also this one for an better performance

#                                                      the signal SIGTERM for termination.
#                                                      with command "PPI-DEF stop" the server change sending signal
#                                                      follow signals are allowed:

#               2 - count the time in the case of begin and or while down to 0

#
#   ACTIONS:
#  ----------
#    one or more actions can be set by the property action
#    when more be set, it must be separated with an pipe ('|')
#
#   activate    - for type TIMER
#                 count down the second to an setting date
#
#   alwaysbegin - for type TIMER
#                 begin count down of full time by every begin
#                 this action is only allowed when TIMER type run in case 2
#
#   block       - for type SHELL
#                 if subroutine is defined with the action wait and the shell command do not
#                 ending directly, it will be block the hole subroutine and maybe also other folders
#                 in this case define the subroutine with action block. And while during the shell
#                 command runs, the subroutine starting no new command, otherwise he lock only for result
#                 This action is only useful when also action wait is set, and gives an warning by start server
#
#   db          - writing actual state on database
#                 witch values are will be write from subroutines with this action
#                 and how long the values are holding in database
#                 you can read in default.conf or some defined configuration files
#                 for explicitly modules
#
#   int         - for type VALUE
#                 when the value or subroutine can have only an integer
#                 elsewhere an floating number
#
#   measure     - for type TIMER
#                 calculate time length and not as default an count down
#
#   micro       - for type TIMER
#                 result is before decimal point full seconds and then milliseconds
#                 and microseconds in 1000'th steps
#                 the highest value can only be 60 * 60 seconds (3600)
#
#   noerrorlog  - for type SHELL
#                 do not write shell script error into log file
#                 maybe you need the result of script inside the subroutine.
#                 If it's possible to write the command (PPI-DEF noerrorlog) into the script
#                 it's an better job to do this shortly before exit with number.
#                 Because when script ending on other position with an real error
#                 you can not see the error in log file (Only by debugging folder:subroutine)
#
#   poll        - for type TIMER
#                 beginning time measure again by 0 or full time
#                 when no ending found inside while or end parameters
#                 this action is only allowed when TIMER type run in case 2 or 4
#
#   print       - for type DEBUG
#                 display string/value on command line
#                 this action is default when no log property be set
#
#   sec         - for type TIMER (default)
#                 result is an integer of seconds
#
#   wait        - for type SHELL
#                 subroutine should waiting for end of command
#                 in this case the value of the subroutine is the return value of the command
