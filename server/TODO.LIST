toDo:
  ppi-server
  - subroutine objects of portBaseClass has two methods (getType() and getSubroutineType())
    which make the same things. remove one of them
  - make also possible to starting ppi-owreader processes per time over TIMER subroutine
  - make possible to read current subroutine time into subroutine value
  - subroutine READ can currently only read from http connection
    to set query string
    make possible to read content and evaluate
    and also to read other connection types
    maybe read from file or from SOA for WebServices
  - writing man pages for ppi-server (maybe make possibility to write XML-files from MainParams)
  - generate documentation over doxygen
  - making --help usage for ppi-client over own classes of MainParams and ParamCommand
  - writing ncursos/termbox possibility for ppi-client
  - sending debug output over ppi-internet-server
  - writing external port creation as plug-in by reading shared objects
  - writing shared object libppicppclient.so similar to java class at.kolli.automation.client.ClientConnector.java
  - write methods for ppi_time to calculate also with normally double/integer values
    and also globally friend functions to calculate ppi_time= timeval/double/integer + ppi_time
  - finish transforming and receiving IR commands over lirc
  - write QUICK-GUID documentation for first starting with ppi-server
  - make possible for ppi-internet-server to hear on both protocols (IPv4/IPv6) in same time
  - writing communication over SOCKET's
  - making SSL support
  - make Hudson/Jenkins testing
  - writing unit tests
  
  ppi-java-client
  - refactoring hole process to an MVC-pattern
  - create Andoid-App with project Tabris from eclipse

known bugs:
  ppi-server
  - reading of objectID from OWFS (external port) can be refused
  - by reading of subroutine READ when action set to hold connection
    make some problem by reconnect or thinking connection is open
  - error handling CommandExec->ShellWriter not correct and not documented
  - when content of inform property for folder is fault
    user do not see any error or warning
  - CalculatorContainer do not stopping when result is false
    and an logical >> and('&') <<  with container follow (see power_switch informing folder)
  - subroutine SHELL do not use last changing time from begin/while/end parameter
    for own changing set (and check also whether all other subroutines do right)
  - by pressing some button in ppi-java-client but not allowed
    client get no info to jump toggle button again back out
    maybe set SWITCH routine back to 0 is to fast
    and give no info to database
  - by reading properties from measure.conf
    server do not recognize when an parameter has an content over more rows
    with beginning quotes, but the ending are forgotten
