#	layout description
#	written by Alexander Kolli
#

extension of files are as default .desktop
when you start the java-client with parameter -s
like >> java -jar ppi-java-client.jar -s touchscreen
the client take all files from server with this extension (*.touchscreen)
the server look in this subdirectory "client"
and send the sources as folder description to the client
the position from an folder in the tree of the left side
can affect with the name of the layout files
also it's posible to make subdirectory again
to create an real tree.

first all included tag is <layout> ... </layout>
there can inherit two tags
the <head></haead> and <body></body> tag like HTML
in the body tag you can set also other tags (see folow tag description) and text like HTML
all tags which not inherit other tags
must have an slash "/" before closing with ">" like XHtml
as entity you can use :
    &lt;    for    <
    &gt;    for    >
    &apos;  for    '
    &quot;  for    "
all other known entitys can bring an layout ERROR (The entity "xxx" was referenced, but not defined)
also you can use the Unicode standard dezimal (&#<number>;) or hexadezimal (&#x<number>;) numbers
like &#8364; or &#x20AC; for the euro character
or &#160; for an null character if you want to display more then one null characters


now see all allowed tags you can use:

<head>:
  elements: attribute:    description:

  <meta name="<value>" content="<value>" />
  
    allowed names:
           permission     -  for hole side permission
                             content value is string of group name
           pageset        -  inform server that client display this side
                             client inform then also that he leave this side
                             unless the side has no body
                             content value have to be an folder with subroutine separated with an colon
           display        -  whether client should show this side
                             this can be used for sides which you don't want to use this time, define display with false
                             or you don't want to see the side inside the navigation tree
                             when only should shown the page from server defined with meta tag pageset,
                             define display with notree
                             normally if you write an side with no body,
                             the most time for an folder to give specific permission or other name as the file name,
                             but the folder has no content inside the folder, the client do not show this sub folder.
                             In this case, by maybe some reasons, if you want to see always this side
                             is still in the navigation tree or popup menu
                             define display with true
                             content value should be an string of true, false or notree
           popupwidth     -  by starting with -t --notree
                             width of pop-up button on top
                             content value is an unsigned integer
           popupheight    -  by starting with -t --notree
                             height of pop-up button on top
                             content value is an unsigned integer
           popupspace     -  margin space arround the menu string
           popupcolor     -  background color for pop-up menu button
           popupfont      -  character font in pop-up button
           popupfontcolor -  color or characters inside pop-up button
           popupfontsize  -  character size inside pop-up button
           popupfontstyle -  bold and or italic style for characters seperated with an colon
           
  <title>
            real title at the tree on the left side
            is the defined name in the title tag
            If this tag is not defined, it apear the name of
            file without extension
